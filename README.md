Valorant itself has experienced development since it was first released until now Valorant has had its own tournament event known as the Valorant Champions Tour which is divided into several regions of America, Pacific, China, and Europe. It is the project data analysis is expected to be able to provide an overview of how the performance of each player and team in participating in the VCT APAC 2023 activity.
